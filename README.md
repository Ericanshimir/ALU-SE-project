Description:

This project is called "empowering youth through technology" and it aims to establish a tech hub in Burundi, providing free resources, training, and mentorship to empower 500 Burundian youths within a year. It tackles the challenges of limited technology access and education among Burundian youth. My belief is that technology can help in the development of communities and stimulate economic growth.
