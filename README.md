This project is called empowering youth through technology and it aims to establish a tech hub in Burundi, providing free resources, training, and mentorship to empower 500 Burundian youths within a year. It tackles the challenges of limited technology access and education among Burundian youth. Embracing Agile development, the project remains adaptable to evolving tech requirements. My belief is that technology can help in the development of communities and stimulate economic growth.
